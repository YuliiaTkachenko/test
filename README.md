## üé¨ Getting Started
1. In a new project directory, run [Theme Kit's 'new' command to generate a new theme on your store](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/commands/#new). After that theme has been uploaded to your store, delete the new local theme files that Theme Kit downloaded to your directory as you won't need them. The starter liquid files included `dist/` are the same files you'll get when generating a new theme with Theme Kit.
2. Download and unzip this repo, and move all files into your new directory created in step 1.
3. Open terminal, cd into your project directory, and and run `npm install` to install packages.
3. In Shopify, copy the theme ID for the new theme, then update the `<PASSWORD>`, `THEME_ID`, and `STORE_URL` in **config.yml** with your store & theme details.
4. Your `config.yml` file should look like this: 
    ```
    development:
      password: <PRIVATE_APP_PASSWORD>
      theme_id: "<THEME_ID>"
      store: <STORE_URL>
      directory: dist/
      ignore_files:
        - config/settings_data.json
    ```
5. If migrating an existing theme, copy over all assets, liquid and config files from your theme into their respective directories in `src/`.
6. Run `npm start` to run your first Webpack build and start watching for file changes to be uploaded to Shopify.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### NPM

#### Scripts
`npm start`
- Completes a Webpack build in **development** mode
- Webpack begins watching for file changes
- Theme Kit begins watching for file changes in `dist/`
- Theme Kit opens your development theme in your default browser

`npm run build`
- Completes a Webpack build in **production** mode

`npm run deploy`
- Completes a Webpack build in **production** mode
- Deploys dist folder to the **development** theme in `config.yml`

### Webpack

#### Entry Points
All JavaScript files in the `js/bundles` directory & subdirectories are used as entry points. All other JavaScript modules should added to additional subdirectories of `js/`. An entry point file must be created for each liquid template file, including alternate templates. A CSS file for each template and layout should also be added to `styles/layout` and `styles/templates`. These CSS files should be imported at the top of each JavaScript entry file.

#### Output Files
Webpack will generate a JavaScript file for each template and layout file in the `bundles` directory. The CSS files imported in each bundle entry file will also generate CSS files. Webpack will add all output files to `dist/assets`.

### Theme Kit

#### Config
The Theme Kit configuration file uses `dist` as the root directory for watching files to upload.

#### File Uploads
When running `npm start`, Webpack will use a plugin that runs `shopify-themekit watch` after a successful build. Webpack will then watch and recompile entry file changes, and Theme Kit will watch for file changes in the `dist` directory.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Required Files
- The layout and template entry files in `src/js/bundles/` are necessary for Webpack to generate the CSS and JavaScript assets for each layout and template. Additional entry files will be required when creating new liquid templates or alternate templates, ie. `page.about.js`.
- The `style-bundle.liquid` and `script-bundle.liquid` snippets output dynamic asset URLs based on current layout and template. These have been added to sample `theme.liquid`. The `layout` variable is required.

#### Shopify Plus Stores
If your store is on Shopify Plus, you'll need to do the following:
- Create `checkout.scss` and add to `src/styles/layout/`.
- Create `checkout.js` and add to `src/js/bundles/layout/`.
- Add `import "Styles/layout/checkout.scss";` in `checkout.js`.
- Render the style-bundle and script-bundle snippets in `checkout.liquid` by changing the snippet's layout variable value to `checkout`. ie. `{% render 'style-bundle', layout: 'checkout' %}` and `{% render 'script-bundle', layout: 'checkout' %}`.

## üìù Notes
- Subdirectories are allowed in `assets/`, `js/`, `styles/`, `snippets/`.
- A `Styles` module alias for the styles directory is ready to use. ie. `import "Styles/layout/theme.scss"`.
- To reference an asset url in an SCSS file such as a background image, just use `./filename.ext`, since all final CSS and images live in the `dist/assets/` directory.
- If you add a new JavaScript entry file to `js/bundles/` while Webpack and Theme Kit are watching for changes, you'll need to end the process and run `npm start` again so that Webpack is aware of the new entry file.
- A git pre-commit hook is installed that will run `webpack build` prior to the commit. This is useful if using a code deployment tool so that you never push and deploy an unbuilt theme.
- `clean-webpack-plugin` was intentionally not included to make incremental deployments faster using [Buddy](https://buddy.works/). If you remove a bundle entry file, you'll also need to delete the bundle files from `dist/assets`.
- If you update or switch node versions using `nvm`, you will need to run `npm rebuild node-sass` to refresh node-sass for your current environment.
- When merging 2 git feature branches, you only need to resolve the conlficts inside `src/`. Any conflicts inside `dist/` can be resolved with `npm run build`. Always run `npm run build` after resolving merge conflicts.
- Vendor CSS and JS files can be added to `src/assets/vendor`, and will be copied into `dist/assets`.
